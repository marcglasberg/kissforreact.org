# Comparing with Zustand

Zustand is a barebones state management solution,
providing just the essentials needed for state management without extensive
setup or complexity. For advanced features you need to install separate packages.

Kiss also doesn't need any extensive setup, and is not more complex than Zustand.
However, Kiss is not barebones: The advanced features are there when you need them.
It deals natively with serializing, running async processes, dealing with stale data,
displaying spinners while loading, showing error messages, saving the state to the local storage,
testing, and more.
